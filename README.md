## Why This Exists

There are many GUI wrappers for Claude Code — Conductor, Craft Agents, Vibe Kanban, 1Code, ccswitch, and others. I tried them all. None of them solved the actual problem:

**They wrap Claude Code.** They inject their own prompts, add their own abstractions, and change how Claude behaves. If you love the terminal — and I do — you don't want that. You want Claude Code exactly as it is.

**They only show their own sessions.** Run something in the terminal? It doesn't exist in their UI. You can only see what was executed through *their* tool. The terminal and the GUI are two separate worlds.

**You can't debug what went wrong.** A session failed — but why? The context filled up too fast — but what consumed it? A subagent spawned 5 child agents — but what did they do? Even in the terminal, scrolling back through a long session to reconstruct what happened is nearly impossible.

**You can't monitor what matters.** Want to know when Claude reads `.env`? When a single tool call exceeds 4K tokens of context? When a teammate sends a shutdown request? You'd have to wire up hooks manually, every time, for every project.

**claude-devtools takes a different approach.** It doesn't wrap or modify Claude Code at all. It reads the session logs that already exist on your machine (`~/.claude/`) and turns them into a rich, interactive interface — regardless of whether the session ran in the terminal, in an IDE, or through another tool.

> Zero configuration. No API keys. Works with every session you've ever run.

## Key Features

### :mag: Visible Context Tracking

See exactly what's eating your context window. The **Session Context Panel** breaks down token usage across 6 categories — CLAUDE.md files, @-mentioned files, tool outputs, extended thinking, team coordination, and user messages — so you can instantly identify what's consuming tokens and optimize your workflow.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Rich Tool Call Inspector

Every tool call is paired with its result in an expandable card. Specialized viewers render each tool natively:
- **Read** calls show syntax-highlighted code with line numbers
- **Edit** calls show inline diffs with added/removed highlighting
- **Bash** calls show command output
- **Subagent** calls show the full execution tree, expandable in-place

### :bell: Custom Notification Triggers

Define rules for when you want to be notified. Match on regex patterns, assign colors, and filter your inbox by trigger. Built-in triggers catch common errors out of the box; add your own for project-specific patterns.

### :busts_in_silhouette: Team & Subagent Visualization

When Claude uses multi-agent orchestration, see the full picture. Teammate messages render as color-coded cards. Subagent sessions are expandable inline with their own execution traces, metrics, and tool calls.

### :zap: Command Palette & Cross-Session Search

Hit **Cmd+K** for a Spotlight-style command palette. Search across all sessions in a project — results show context snippets with highlighted keywords. Navigate directly to the exact message.

### :bar_chart: Multi-Pane Layout

Open multiple sessions side-by-side. Drag-and-drop tabs between panes, split views, and compare sessions in parallel — like a proper IDE for your AI conversations.
